This file lists the psuedo-code for each rule.


1. LOOP-PO

for each thread t in the trace:
    # Add edge from ops/blocks before enterloop to all ops/blocks subsequent to
    # them.
    block-i = first block in t
    block-enterloop = block containing enterloop of t
    last-block-in-t = last block in thread t
    for each block b in {block-i, ... block-enterloop}:
        block-j = next block after b in t
	for each block b' in {block-j, ... last-block-in-t}:
	    add-block-edge(b, b')
	    op-i = last op of b
	    op-j = first op of b'
	    add-op-edge(op-i, op-j)

    # Add edge from ops/blocks after enterloop to all ops/blocks after exitloop
    block-i = block after block-enterloop
    block-exitloop = block containing exitloop of t
    for each block b in {block-exitloop, ... last-block-in-t}:
	block-j = block before b;
	for each block b' in {block-i, ... block-j}:
	    add-block-edge(b, b')
	    op-i = last op of b
	    op-j = first op of b'
	    add-op-edge(op-i, op-j)


2. TASK-PO

for each task p in the trace:
	# Add edge from op/block-1 to op/block-2 if op/block-1 is observed
	# before op/block-2 in p
	block-i = first block in p
	block-last = last block in p
	for each block b in {block-i, ... block-last}:
