This repository contains the baseline implementation of race-detection algorithm used in
SparseRacer.

Compile:
	cd Debug
	make clean
	make

Run:
	./Debug/sparseracer <trace-file> -rr [options]

The options are the same as the ones in "finaltool" branch.
Note: This branch uses blocks for ST rules and but disables it for MT rules.
